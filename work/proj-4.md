[Bloc Jams](https://bloc-jams-angularjs.herokuapp.com/album){:target="_blank"} was the first site I developed during my time at Bloc. Since the focus was on functionality, All designs and content were premade (although every time I look back at the design I get an urge to re-design it). The main focus was on creating a working music player. I actually developed the functionality on this website 2 different times. First using a mix of vanilla JS and Jquery, and then again using Angular JS. You can take a look at my code for the Jquery version [Jquery version](https://github.com/EricSSartorius/bloc-jams){:target="_blank"}. or [AngularJS version](https://github.com/EricSSartorius/bloc-jams-angular){:target="_blank"} of Bloc Jams along with code for other projects I have been working on at [Github](https://github.com/EricSSartorius){:target="_blank"}. Working on this site was a great lesson in how 2 things that look exactly the same can be coded extremely different.
