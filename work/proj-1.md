[U-judge](http://ujudge.meteorapp.com/home){:target="_blank"} is the first large-scale project that I decided to undertake. I have been working in Angular-Meteor to make it come alive and all code can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/EricSSartorius/Judging-System){:target="_blank"}.
U-Judge is still in the works so currently the only type of event that can be judged follows the format of a figure skating or skateboarding competition. In the future, the ability to create and judge 1v1 or team vs team matches, among other custom features will also be implemented. I am very eager to see U-Judge working in the way I envision it and U-Judge 1.0 should be finished very shortly so stay tuned!
