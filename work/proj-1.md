Epic Judge (still not officially named) is the first large-scale project that I decided to undertake. I have been working in Angular-Meteor to make it come alive. All code for Epic Judge can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/EricSSartorius/Judging-System){:target="_blank"}.

During my time in South Korea, I worked as the head administrator for O.U.R. System, a judging system for breakdance competitions. After years of using the system, I learned a lot about things I liked and that I would also like to see changed about the program that runs the O.U.R. System. Also, I did some research online and realized that there are no simple online judging systems that can be used for a variety of sports and events. So, I decided to combine my experience as a judging system administrator and front-end developer to create Epic Judge. 

Epic Judge is still in in beta, so currently the only type of event that can be judged follows the format of a figureskating or skateboarding competition. Players take turns one by one performing during a timed round and judges input their scores accordingly. In the future, the ability to create and judge 1v1 or team vs team matches, among other custom features will also be implemented.

So how does this all work? Upon signing in and creating an event, the admin can then assign judges to their event. These judges can be anywhere in the world as long as they are connected to the net. If your judges are lazy they can even judge your event via Skype while sitting at home. 

Although there is still a lot of work such as adding features and finishing the design, I am very eager to see Epic Judge working in the way I envision it to so progress towards the final product is being made daily. The Epic Judge 1.0 should be finished very shortly so stay tuned for deployment!
