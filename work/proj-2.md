[Bloc Time](https://bloc-jams-angularjs.herokuapp.com/album){:target="_blank"} is a minimalistic pomodoro timer with access to a task list function upon login. The web app was developed in AngularJS, styled using Angular Material, and Firebase is used for the backend. Although this app is simple in design and function, I had a lot of fun making it and that is good enough for me! The code for Bloc Time can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/EricSSartorius/bloctime){:target="_blank"}.
